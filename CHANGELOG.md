* Expose `onRealSpeechStart` callback to notify when the number of speech positive frames exceeds the minimum speech frames (i.e. not a misfire event).

## 0.0.4

* Fixed a bug where default `modelPath` was not picked up, resulting in silent failure if `modelPath` was not provided.

* Added comments for all public methods and classes.

## 0.0.3
